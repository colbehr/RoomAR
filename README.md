## RoomAR

The RoomAR app is an Android application that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to generate 3D models of rooms. With the app's simple interface and augmented reality camera, users can effortlessly capture their physical environments, enabling them to export virtual representations of their rooms.

### Features

1. **AR Scanning**: The app leverages the power of AR to scan and capture the dimensions of a room. Users simply need to place points in each corner of the room by using their device's camera.

2. **Annotation**: Users can annotate and label specific elements within the 3D model and input more precise measurements after the initial capture is done. (This is not implemented yet)

3. **Export and Sharing**: Once the 3D model is generated, users can export it in various formats, including industry-standard file types compatible with popular CAD software. Users can also share the models with others via email, messaging apps, or cloud storage services.

The RoomAR app simplifies the process of capturing and digitizing room environments using the power of augmented reality. Its user-friendly interface make it an interesting tool for anyone seeking to visualize and plan with ease.


### Development

The RoomAR app is developed using the [SceneView](https://github.com/SceneView/sceneview-android) library in Android Studio using Kotlin.


### Notes:

This app succeeeds an older version of the app that did not use Jetpack Compose.
